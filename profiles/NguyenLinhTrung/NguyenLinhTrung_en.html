Since 2006, he has been working at VNU University of Engineering and Technology (VNU-UET) within Vietnam National University, Hanoi (VNU), served as Vice-Dean of the Faculty of Electronics and Telecommunications during 2009-2013, Head of the Department of Academic Affairs during 2013-2014, Director of the Advanced Institute of Engineering and Technology during 2017-2024. He was recognized as Associate Professor of Electronics in 2012 and Full Professor of Electronics in 2025.<br>

            Dr. Nguyen Linh Trung focuses on signal processing theories and methods, including time-frequency analysis, signal separation, compressed sensing, subspace and tensor tracking, system identification, complex systems, and machine learning. He is also interested in applications of signal processing in telecommunications and medicine. In telecommunications, they include channel estimation, synchronization, physical layer security, and cybersecurity. In medicine, they include analysis and processing of brain signals and images, applying artificial intelligence models in the diagnosis and treatment of neurological diseases such as epilepsy, Alzheimer’s disease, and multiple sclerosis. He has co-authored 3 books and more than 150 scientific papers and book-chapters, and has co-supervised 10 PhD students.<br>

            Dr. Nguyen Linh Trung is an IEEE Senior Member.
