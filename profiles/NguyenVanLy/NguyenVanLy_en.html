            Van Ly Nguyen received the Ph.D. degree in Computational Science from the University of California, Irvine (UCI) and San Diego State University (SDSU), CA, USA, in 2022; the M.Sc. degree in Wireless Communications Systems from CentraleSupélec, Paris-Saclay University, France in 2016; and the B.Eng. degree in Electronics and Telecommunications from Vietnam National University, Hanoi, in 2014. He worked as a postdoctoral researcher at the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science (EECS), UCI from 8/2022 to 1/2025 and at the Elmore Family School of Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE), Purdue University from 2/2025 to 8/2025. He is currently an Assistant Professor in the EECS department and the Institute of Information Sciences (I2S) at the University of Kansas (KU), USA. His research interests lie in the areas of wireless communications, signal processing, and machine learning. He received a Best Paper Award at the 2020 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC).<br>

            My research interests encompass a broad range of areas, including wireless communications, signal processing, machine learning, and communication theory. Current topics of interest include:
            <ul>
                  <li>Next-generation (6G-and-beyond) wireless communications systems</li>
                  <li>Machine learning and statistical learning for wireless communications systems</li>
                  <li>MIMO, massive MIMO, cell-free massive MIMO, distributed MIMO</li>
                  <li>Integrated sensing and communications</li>
                  <li>Millimeter-wave and Terahertz communications</li>
                  <li>Non-terrestrial networks (NTN)</li>
