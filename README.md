## Guide for Editing your Research

1. **Fork the repository** to your own GitHub account.
2. **Add a separate `.bib` file for each individual** in the `/bibs` folder. For example: `DoHaiSon.bib`, `DamThaiNinh.bib`.
3. **Each member of the NNC group is responsible for editing their own `.bib` file**. This can be done either:
   - Offline: Clone the forked repository to your local machine and edit your `.bib` file.
   - Online: Edit your `.bib` file directly in the web browser (GitHub web interface).
4. **After editing**, save your changes and create a pull request to the main repository.
5. **The admin is responsible for reviewing and merging the latest `.bib` files** from all members.
